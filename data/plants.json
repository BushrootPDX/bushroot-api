It is an erect, many branched subshrub, 30–60 cm tall with hairy stems and simple opposite green or purple leaves that are strongly scented. Leaves have petioles and are ovate, up to 5 cm long, usually slightly toothed. The flowers are purplish in elongate racemes in close whorls. The two main morphotypes cultivated in India and Nepal are green-leaved (Sri or Lakshmi tulasi) and purple-leaved (Krishna tulasi).\r\n\r\nTulasi is cultivated for religious and medicinal purposes, and for its essential oil. It is widely known across the Indian Subcontinent as a medicinal plant and an herbal tea, commonly used in Ayurveda, and has an important role within the Vaishnavite tradition of Hinduism, in which devotees perform worship involving holy basil plants or leaves.\r\n\r\nThe variety of Ocimum tenuiflorum used in Thai cuisine is referred to as Thai holy basil (Thai language: กะเพรา kaphrao); it is not to be confused with Thai basil, which is a variety of Ocimum basilicum.",

It has an oyster-like taste that some consider more subtle than Black Salsify. It can be eaten boiled or mashed; skin is inedible and should be removed.

        "description": "Capiscum is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae that produces peppers. The Capiscum genus contains 20-27 species of peppers which vary in color, shape, size, and heat. 5 species are domesticated. Most peppers are green when unripe and change color as the fruit matures. The fruit of most species contains capsaicin, which gives hot peppers their spiciness. Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) are an exception: they do not contain capsaicin due to a recessive gene, and are therefore not spicy. The Scoville scale is used to measure the relative heat of peppers. Bell peppers have a rating of 0-25 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), jalapenos are between 2,500-10,000 SHU. All peppers, regardless of species, prefer a long, warm growing season and well-drained soil high in organic matter. Seeds can be started indoors 8-10 weeks before hardening off and transplanting. In cooler climates, it can be preferable to grow peppers in containers indoors to extend the growing season and prevent frost from killing plants. Peppers have an upright growing habit and can benefit from staking to help the plant support the fruits.",

As a cover crop, it builds organic matter and suppresses weeds with its rapid and dense growth, brings up phosphorus and calcium from deep in the soil, prevents erosion, and attracts pollinators. The nectar from buckwheat flowers makes a dark-colored honey. Buckwheat's leaves can be eaten raw or cooked like spinach. Seed should be harvested just before the first killing frost.

As the fruits age, the skin becomes tougher and less edible, but the pith becomes sweet and intensely red and is often used raw in salads. The fruit turns orange and mushy and splits when it is fully ripe. Bitter melon is used in Ayurvedic medicine and eaten as a treatment for malaria in some countries (it's bitter flavor is due to the melon's quinine content.) To aid germination, scarify and dunk seeds in boiling water for no more than four seconds, then drain on a paper towel for a few minutes before sowing.

They are often more disease-resistant, but have a shorter shelf life than conventional tomatoes. Some cultivars can be prone to cracking. Heirlooms often have a higher water content than conventional tomatoes and are often eaten raw with freshly ground salt and pepper, fresh basil, olive oil, and mozzarella.",
